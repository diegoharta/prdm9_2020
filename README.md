## Get Prdm9 up and running on Linux

### How to download and build

To get Prdm9 from a machine connected to the internet, type in a terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegoharta/prdm9_2020
```

This should create a folder called `prdm9_2020` (the root folder).
You must go there before compiling:

```bash
cd prdm9_2020
```

Then, to build and test simply run:

```bash
make test
```
